  <summary>Final Project</summary>


**(Presentation needed)**

During this project, we will work in groups to plan, design, and implement an **Open Source project**.

We already have the **UI design** and the **Backend** prepared, and we will focus on integrating them together, improving features, and ensuring the system works efficiently and smoothly.

Each group must go through the following process:

- Reviewing and understanding the provided **UI design** and **Backend structure**.
- Coding the project in **Flutter**, connecting it with the existing Backend, and implementing the required functionalities.

## 📌 Notes & Tips

- لتفعيل الروابط الانتقالية (anchor links) داخل GitHub README، تأكدي إن العناوين موجودة بنفس النص المستخدم بالروابط أو استخدمي الـ `<a id="..."></a>` كما في الملف.
- لو عايزة أضيف وصف لكل Week (مهام، تمارين، روابط فيديو) أكمّل الباقي بنفس التنسيق.
- لو عايزة أحول الملف ده فعليًا لملف README.md للتحميل هنا، أعملهولِك وحطّك لينك للتحميل.
