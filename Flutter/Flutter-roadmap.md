### ✅ Task 1: CLI Game – Hangman **(No Presentation Required)**

- 🧠 What to Do:
    - Research the rules and logic behind the game.
    - Implement it as a Command Line Interface (CLI) app.
    - Use Dart and apply OOP if possible.
- 📦 Deliverables:
    - Dart source code files
    - Optional:  A simple `README.md` explaining how to run the app.

---

### ✅ **Task 2: System Analysis & OOP Implementation (with Presentation)**

- **🧠 What to Do:**
    1. Choose **one** of the following systems:
        - 🚗 Car Rental System
        - 💼 Sales Management System
        - 🏨 Hotel Booking System
    2. Analyze the selected system:
        - Define main **elements/entities**
        - Map out **relationships** between them
        - Identify the **main process flow**
    3. Implement the system in Dart using **OOP principles**
    4. Prepare a presentation to explain your analysis and code

**📦 Deliverables:**

- Dart project source code  
- Simple UML diagram (basic is fine, hand-drawn or digital)  
- Slides or PDF presentation  

---

### ✅ **Task 3: UI Implementation & Widget Tree**

- **🧠 What to Do:**
    - Visit the provided screen design:  
      [Beginner Project - Screen](https://www.notion.so/Beginner-Project-Screen-1968988f7cf6814dbba4f828cddbe5e2?pvs=21)
        
    - Build the widget tree based on the design
    
> Notes:  
> - Try to implement the design **pixel-perfect** (matching dimensions, spacing, and layout) as much as possible.  
> - **Also:** Make sure the buttons work — try to implement their actions as close to the intended behavior as possible.

**📦 Deliverables:**

- Flutter UI implementation code  
- Widget tree diagram
